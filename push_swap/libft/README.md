## Description

**Libft** is a foundational C project from the 42 curriculum where the goal is to build your own static C library.  
This library reimplements a set of standard libc functions and adds additional utility functions, including linked list manipulation.  
The main purpose of this project is to deeply understand how common C functions work internally, improve memory management skills, and create a reusable library for future projects.

The output of this project is a static library called **libft.a**.

## Instructions

### Compilation

To compile the library, run:

```bash
make
```

This will generate the file `libft.a` at the root of the repository.

### Makefile Rules

The Makefile includes the following rules:
- `make` or `make all` : compile the library
- `make clean` : remove object files
- `make fclean` : remove object files and `libft.a`
- `make re` : rebuild the library from scratch

All files are compiled using the flags:

```bash
-Wall -Wextra -Werror
```

### Usage

To use the library in your project:

```c
#include "libft.h"
```

Then compile your program with:

```bash
gcc main.c libft.a
```

## Library Content

The library is composed of three main parts:

### 1. Libc Functions Reimplementation

Reimplementation of standard C library functions, all prefixed with `ft_`, such as:
- Character checks: `ft_isalpha`, `ft_isdigit`, `ft_isalnum`, `ft_isascii`, `ft_isprint`
- String functions: `ft_strlen`, `ft_strchr`, `ft_strrchr`, `ft_strncmp`, `ft_strnstr`
- Memory functions: `ft_memset`, `ft_bzero`, `ft_memcpy`, `ft_memmove`, `ft_memchr`, `ft_memcmp`
- Conversion and case: `ft_atoi`, `ft_toupper`, `ft_tolower`
- Allocation-based functions: `ft_calloc`, `ft_strdup`

### 2. Additional Utility Functions

Functions not present in libc or implemented differently:
- String manipulation: `ft_substr`, `ft_strjoin`, `ft_strtrim`, `ft_split`
- Conversion: `ft_itoa`
- Iteration helpers: `ft_strmapi`, `ft_striteri`
- File descriptor output: `ft_putchar_fd`, `ft_putstr_fd`, `ft_putendl_fd`, `ft_putnbr_fd`

### 3. Linked List Functions

A full set of functions to manipulate singly linked lists using the `t_list` structure:
- Creation and insertion: `ft_lstnew`, `ft_lstadd_front`, `ft_lstadd_back`
- Navigation: `ft_lstsize`, `ft_lstlast`
- Deletion and cleanup: `ft_lstdelone`, `ft_lstclear`
- Iteration and mapping: `ft_lstiter`, `ft_lstmap`

## Technical Notes

- No global variables are used.
- All heap-allocated memory is properly freed.
- Helper functions are declared as `static` when needed.
- The library is built using `ar`, as required.

## Resources

- `man` pages for standard C library functions
- GNU C Library Documentation
- 42 Intranet documentation for the **libft** project

### AI Usage

AI was used only as a **learning support tool** to:
- Clarify function behavior and edge cases
- Review explanations and documentation structure

No code was blindly copied, and all implementations were written and understood by the author.
